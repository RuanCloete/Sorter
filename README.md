AlgoSorter is my first web application I am proud enough to showcase. The application uses multiple sorting algorithms to visualize a group, consisting of 120 columns, being sorted by length in ascending order, the algorithms used are quick -, bubble -and merge sort.

I was inspired to make this project by a web dev/ youtuber, Clément Mihailescu. I was drawn to creating this project because I wanted to challenge -and prove to myself that the countless hours I had invested into learning code has paid off. For the week I spent creating AlgoSorter I enjoyed reverse engineering the algorhitms and utilizing exciting coding concepts as I made progress. I had also learned a lot creating this project, especially after being disapointed looking at AlgoSorter's code months later, I had made gigantic improvements in my coding skills and design patterns so I refactored all the algorhitms.

Edit: I have updated AlgoSorter a few times as I had made tremendous improvements in my knowledge of OOP. I encapsulated each sorting method to remove global variables from previous versions and I've improved responsiveness for mobile devices.

SPECIAL THANKS: 
Clément Mihailescu for inspiring me(1) to make AlgoSorter, and his guided implementation of the merge sort algorithms(2) that helped immensely with the 
implementation of the quick -and bubble sort.
